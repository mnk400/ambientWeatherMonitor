# Ambient Weather Monitor

A simple ambient indoor weather statistics measuring and logging system written completely in python consisting of a HTTP server and an MQTT client. Designed to work on raspberry pi's and senseHATs.

The HTTP/MQTT bindings can be further used to integrate the project into further projects.

##### Two examples: 

- Using MQTT on node-red to build a dashboard.
